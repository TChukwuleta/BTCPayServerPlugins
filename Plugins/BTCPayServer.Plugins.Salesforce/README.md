1. Local: These apps are developed and used exclusively within a single Salesforce org. They cannot be distributed to other orgs and are not copied to a new sandbox when you clone or refresh a sandbox. This setting is ideal for apps that are specific to a single organization and do not require sharing or distribution.
Packaged: These apps are designed to be included in second-generation (2GP) managed packages and can be distributed to subscriber orgs. This setting enables the app to be shared across multiple organizations, making it suitable for apps that need to be deployed in various environments or shared with other Salesforce users. Packaged external client apps are copied to sandboxes during refresh or clone operations, ensuring consistency across environments.
